# Construction AI Platform - Development Memory

This document serves as a persistent memory of our development process, tracking key decisions, implementations, and future plans.

## Current Development Status

### Project Overview
The Construction AI Platform is an AI-powered solution for construction plan analysis and quote generation, featuring automated element detection, dimension extraction, and cost estimation capabilities.

### Repository Structure
- `/backend`: FastAPI backend with AI processing services
- `/frontend`: React.js frontend with Tailwind CSS and ShadCN components
- `/plugins`: Core and additional trade-specific plugins (to be implemented)
- `/docs`: Documentation for users, developers, and API (to be implemented)

### Implemented Features

#### Frontend
- **Authentication**: Login and Registration pages
- **Dashboard**: Main dashboard UI
- **Documents Management**:
  - Document listing page with grid/list views
  - Document upload functionality
  - Document viewer with AI analysis results
- **Projects Management**:
  - Projects listing page with sorting and filtering
  - Project creation functionality
  - Project details page with tasks, milestones, documents, and estimations

#### Backend
- Basic API structure with FastAPI
- HostGator deployment configuration

### In-Progress Features
- Integration between frontend and backend services
- Estimations functionality implementation
- AI models for document processing

### Next Steps
- Implement Estimations page for cost calculations
- Implement Plugins management
- Add comprehensive API endpoints for document processing
- Develop AI models for element detection and measurement extraction
- Implement Settings page for user and application configurations

## Development Decisions

### 2025-03-24
- Decided to focus on the main `construction-ai-platform` repository rather than the newly created `construction-ai-platform-app`
- Implemented memory tracking with PROJECT_MEMORY.md and PROJECT_PLAN.md
- Implemented Documents page with grid/list views and DocumentUploadForm component
- Implemented DocumentViewer for processing results visualization
- Implemented Projects and ProjectDetails pages with comprehensive project management features

## Known Issues
- Need to connect frontend components to actual backend services instead of mock data
- Full authentication flow requires implementation
- PDF/CAD rendering capabilities need to be added to DocumentViewer

## Questions and Clarifications
- Confirm deployment strategy for both frontend and backend on HostGator
- Determine priority for next feature implementation
- Clarify AI model integration approach

## Tech Stack Decisions
- Using React Query for data fetching
- Using ShadCN UI components for consistent design
- Using Tailwind CSS for styling
- Using FastAPI for backend services
- Using Jotai for state management
